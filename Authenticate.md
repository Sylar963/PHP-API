# Project Authentication & Architecture

## Project Overview
**Project**: Project Management & Team Collaboration Application  
**Architecture**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) combined with Clean Architecture  
**Framework**: Laravel 11.x  
**Status**: Initial Development Phase  

## Authentication System

### Primary Authentication Method
- **Laravel Sanctum** for API token-based authentication
- **Passport** for OAuth2 if needed for third-party integrations
- Standard Laravel authentication for web interface

### User Roles & Permissions
- **Super Admin**: Full system access
- **Project Manager**: Manage projects, assign tasks, manage teams
- **Team Lead**: Manage assigned teams and projects
- **Team Member**: Access assigned tasks and projects
- **Client/Viewer**: Limited read-only access to specific projects

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login/Registration**: Standard email/password authentication
2. **Token Generation**: Sanctum generates API tokens for frontend access
3. **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeout
4. **Password Reset**: Secure password reset via email verification
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Optional 2FA for enhanced security

### Security Measures
- **CSRF Protection**: Laravel's built-in CSRF protection
- **XSS Prevention**: Automatic input sanitization and output escaping
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Eloquent ORM with prepared statements
- **Rate Limiting**: API throttling to prevent abuse
- **JWT Tokens**: For stateless authentication where applicable

## Architecture Overview

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Structure

#### Domain Layer
- **Entities**: Core business objects with identity
  - Project, Task, User, Team, Milestone
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes
  - Email, ProjectStatus, TaskPriority, Timestamp
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of objects treated as a unit
  - Project aggregate (Project, Tasks, Members)
- **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't fit in entities
  - ProjectCollaborationService, TimeTrackingService
- **Domain Events**: Notifications of domain changes
  - TaskCreated, ProjectStatusChanged, UserAssigned

#### Application Layer
- **Commands**: Input objects for business operations
- **Handlers**: Execute business logic for commands
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for inter-layer communication
- **Services**: Application-specific business logic

#### Infrastructure Layer
- **Persistence**: Database implementations (Repository pattern)
- **HTTP**: Controllers, Requests, API resources
- **Events**: Event listeners and dispatchers
- **External Services**: Mail, Notifications, Pusher integration

### Clean Architecture Principles
- **Independence**: Framework, UI, database, and external agencies independent
- **Dependency Rule**: Inner circles don't depend on outer circles
- **Interfaces**: Domain layer defines interfaces, infrastructure implements them

## Technical Infrastructure

### Stack Components
- **Backend**: Laravel 11.x
- **Database**: MySQL 8.x or PostgreSQL 15.x
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Queue System**: Laravel Horizon with Redis
- **Real-time**: Laravel Echo Server with Pusher/Ably
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3.x or React 18.x (SPA)
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
- **Testing**: PHPUnit, Pest, Laravel Dusk
- **Deployment**: Docker

### Database Schema Considerations
- **Projects Table**: id, name, description, status, owner_id, created_at, updated_at
- **Tasks Table**: id, title, description, status, priority, project_id, assigned_to, due_date
- **Users Table**: id, name, email, role, password, created_at, updated_at
- **Teams Table**: id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
- **Team_User Pivot**: team_id, user_id
- **Project_User Pivot**: project_id, user_id

### API Architecture
- **RESTful API** following PSR standards
- **Versioning**: API versioning strategy (v1, v2)
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user API rate limiting
- **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin requests
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration

## Critical Project Understanding

### Business Logic Complexity
The project management tool handles complex business rules:
- Task dependencies and scheduling
- Project timeline calculations
- Resource allocation optimization
- Permission-based access control
- Real-time collaboration features

### Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling for multiple users
- Queue processing for time-intensive operations
- Caching strategies for performance
- Database optimization for large datasets
- Microservice potential for future scaling

### Security Considerations
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for compliance
- Secure file upload handling
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time updates for collaboration
- Fast task searching and filtering
- Efficient project timeline rendering
- Optimized database queries
- Caching strategies for common operations

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards
- PSR-12 coding standards
- Laravel best practices
- SOLID principles implementation
- Proper error handling and logging
- Comprehensive testing coverage

### Version Control
- Git flow branching strategy
- Feature branch development
- Code review process
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Semantic versioning

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Feature tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for critical operations
- Security testing for vulnerabilities

## Project State & Progress
- **Phase**: Initial Architecture Setup
- **Current Status**: Architecture planning and file structure creation
- **Next Milestone**: Domain layer implementation
- **Risk Level**: Medium (due to architectural complexity)
- **Estimated Timeline**: 8-12 weeks for MVP

## Key Stakeholders
- Development Team
- Product Owner
- End Users (Project Managers, Team Members)
- System Administrators
